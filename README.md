# ZuiD (ZUI Documentation)
A tool for documenting a system in a zoomable user interface (ZUI).

## Goal
I like making architecture diagrams. But I think they could be greatly improved
if I could us my mouse to zoom in on the subsystems/subcomponents. Imagine
seeing a box for a cluster of servers and when you used your mouse wheel you
could zoom in, meaning the box would increase in size and the individual
servers which you couldn't see before would appear. And what if you zoomed in
some more and you could see the applications that were deployed on each of
those servers. And how about rotating the image so instead of a box for the
cluster, it was for an application, and zooming in showed the different
servers it was hosted on.
I got some of my inspiration from Prezi, a presentation tool. I would like to
take it a step further where you couldn't see tiny text until you zoomed in.
Instead, the text would have an opacity of 0 and smoothly increase when
zoomed in.

## Viewer
A viewer must be available to allow the sharing of documents with others.

## Creator
An authoring tool to create a sharable document to be viewed by the viewer.

## About Me
I like to start things. But I don't often finish. I have created hundreds of
Minecraft worlds. I like starting fresh. So, if this is as far as this project
goes, at least you will know why.
